Background:

A sleeping volcano in the middle of the 
USA harvests a huge goldmine with great 
recources. But since a few days, earthquakes
are waking up the volcano. An eruption 
won´t be far. So the Nation is 
giving their best to get as much gold out
of the mine as possible before the volcano 
errupts. Globalisation-enemies see a great 
chance in this operation to harm the economy 
of the state. They want to stop the USA from 
getting all the gold out of the mine. But 
several other Nations are sending special 
forces to protect the it. So the 
globalisation-enemies hire trained terrorist 
groups from all over the world to destroy 
the mine and kill everybody that tries to 
stop them. To the advantage of the 
globalisation-enemies, the volcano errupts 
earlier than everybody expected and great 
parts of the mine get destroyed. So the 
terrorists only have to destroy the gold, 
that has already been taken out of the mine. 
Half of it has already been loaded on a train, 
but this train has gotten stuck in a tunnel 
because of all the stones crashing down from 
the ceiling. The other half still lies in 
crates infront of the entrance of the mine.
