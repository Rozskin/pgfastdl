Both teams start in similar bunkers. Inside each bunker is
a sniper post and a ramp leading to the underground storage
facility. The area above ground has little cover, whilst the
area underground is full of crates and other potential cover.

Both teams may buy weapons.

Other Notes: 
There is a pool in the middle of the map which connects above
ground to the underground storage facility. The sniper area is
vulnerable to attacks from below, so it is suggested that
a line of defence is placed above ground to guard against players
coming out of the pool.
