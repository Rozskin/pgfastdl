Backround:
Terrorists have located the secret documents
of America's newest most secret weapon. 
The terrorists fear that this "new" weapon
called the "earthquake machine" AKA
"Shaker maker" may damage or destroy the
entire world. 

Counter-Terrorists: 
Protect the secret documents from bomb
threats.

Terrorists:
Destroy the plans, located in two parts
of the building.

Map Playtester: Darkforce 
"nice map you got here... WTF, pink railings?!"

Special Thanks To:
