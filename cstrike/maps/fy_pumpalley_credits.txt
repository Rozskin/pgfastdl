other maps by me: altavan avenue assault (cs_altavan)

as i believe in open-source sharing, for what it's worth the .rmf, .map and custom wad files for any of my maps are available to anyone who wants them.  just drop me an email and i'll put them up for ya.


textures from:

blazurban.wad - Philip "Blazeeer...!" Klevestav [www.blaz.cscentral.com; blazeeer@lycos.com] (with some ugly snow modifications by me)

maxpayne.wad - thanks to the original maxpayne texture artists and to Lagarto [lagarto115@hotmail.com], who packaged them for cs (again with a 'snow-job' done to some texs)

lm_winter1c.wad (trees VERY slightly mod'd) - by alpha storm aka lord myrkul
